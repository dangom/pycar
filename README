A python package that contains implementations of the following algorithms:

RAICAR : See Z. Yang, S. LaConte, X. Weng, and X. Hu, Human Brain Mapping 29: 711-725 (2008) for the original RAICAR algorithm and Brown, Grafton, and Carlson, 
PLoS ONE 7: e50268 (2012) and Brown et al., Journal of Neuroscience Methods 219: 205-219 (2013) for the modifications I have made.

BICAR : Brown, Grafton, Carlson, PLoS ONE 7: e50268 (2012) and Brown et al., Journal of Neuroscience Methods 219: 205-219 (2013) for details of the BICAR algorithm.

Both RAICAR and BICAR need an external module to run Independent Component Analysis.  They currently use my pyica package, also available on github.

BICAR is significantly more complicated than RAICAR, given that it attempts to find joint reproducible sources in two datasets.  For a 'quick start' in RAICAR:

>>import raicar
>>raicar = RAICAR(projDirectory='scratch')
>>raciar.clean_project()
>>raicar.runall(X)

For quick tests to see if things are working, move into the tests directory and either run:

~>py.test test_raicar_pytest.py

or for the standalone testing script:

~>python runtests.py

X should be a matrix of size Nmixtures x Nsamples, where (ideally) Nsamples >> Nmixtures.  See the documentation on BICAR and RAICAR for full details.
